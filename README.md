# Task-3
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
To explore datasets visually and statistically to understand patterns, relationships, and important features.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Datasets
- Iris Dataset
- Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset

## EDA on Iris Dataset
- Plotted histograms for numerical features
- Identified outliers using box plots
- Analyzed feature relationships using correlation heatmap
- Found petal features most important for prediction

## EDA on Netflix Dataset
- Analyzed categorical features using count plots
- Studied content distribution by rating and type
- Observed release year trends
- Identified missing values in metadata

## Key Insights
- Visualization helps detect patterns and anomalies
- Correlated features influence model performance
- Data imbalance and missing values must be handled before modeling

## Final Outcome
This task builds a strong foundation in understanding data behavior before applying machine learning.
